Sign up for an Olark account and experience the easiest way to boost your sales, help solve issues, and understand your customers with live chat.

== Description ==

Upon signing up for your Olark account, you will receive a Site ID. Simply place this into the plugin and you're good to go, it's that easy! This page features a simple demo of how this integration might look on your website (all appearance settings are managed in your Olark account). Since we aren't logged into our Olark account right now, you'll be met with a contact form instead of a live chat.
